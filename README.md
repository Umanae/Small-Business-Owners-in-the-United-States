 In this project, you'll use data from the 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances.  First, you'll identify households that have a hard time getting credit.  Then you'll build a model to segment these households into subgroups.  Finally, you'll create an interactive web app to share your work.  This project is an example of unsupervised learning, specifically clustering.  It can be used in commercial contexts for marketing or customer segmentation  or in sociological contexts to study social stratification.
